title: Durable State
---

One fundamental feature that separates Membrane from other serverless runtimes is that it is _stateful_.

Programs have a `state` object that persists state between updates (i.e. deploying your program on save) and invocations (i.e. running your program manually or on a timer). To keep data around, put it in the `state` object, and that's it.

You can think of it as: JavaScript objects as the database.

## Basic Example

```ts twoslash
// @module: esnext
// @filename: membrane.d.ts
type State = import("./index").State;
declare module "membrane" {
  /**
   * This object is automatically persisted by Membrane.
   * Its type is defined by the exported `State` interface
   * below.
   */
  export const state: State;
}

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { state } from "membrane";
//       ^^^^^

export interface State {
  count: number;
}

state.count ??= 0;

export function count() {
  state.count++;
}
```

## What durable state unlocks

Persistent `state` means you can store state in one call to a Membrane program and use it again in a subsequent call. You don't need to store data in a database or file to persist itâ€”instead, the state of your program (the JS heap) is transparently and efficiently persisted every time it changes.

:::note
Technically, since the entire JS heap is continually persisted, you could just use module-level variables to store
state. But since each update creates a new ES Module, prior values are not accessible from newer modules, hence the need
for `state` to share state across different version of the program's code (i.e. different ESM modules).

This persistence model also enables behavior that wouldn't be possible in most serverless runtimes. For example, Promises can be `await`'ed indefinitely without worrying about execution timeouts. You might use an indefinite `await` to wait for an [email handler](/features/email).
