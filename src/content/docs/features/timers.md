title: Timers

Membrane programs can be invoked manually or automatically, on a timer. Membrane supports three types of timers:

1. Delays
2. Scheduled
3. Crons

To set up a timer, navigate to the Explorer panel, click on any program, find the [action](/concepts/the-graph#actions) you want to run, and click the clock icon to configure when the program should run.

<!-- TODO: add video of creating a timer from the explorer -->
