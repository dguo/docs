title: Extension Tour

When you open the extension and log in you should be greeted with this view.

On the left is the [Explorer Panel]() where you can see what programs are deployed to your workspace, create new programs, explore a program's graph, update a program's schema and more.

In the main view is the [Welcome Screen](). This only shows up when you first start using Membrane, but gives a useful tour of Membrane and its features that's supplimentary to these docs.

Along the button, under the welcome screen, is the [Logs Panel](). The logs panel displays activity of programs that have been ran.

## Moving the Explorer Panel

Some users prefer having their explorer panel on the right side of the screen so they can still use the file explorer, search, and other features of VSCode without having to continually switch panels.
